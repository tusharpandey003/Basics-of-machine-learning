ML1---

Diabetes prediction with help of tensorflow sequential model.
we load the dataset then visualise it then split the dataset with help of train_test_split() method.
load the tensorflow.keras.Sequential model then train the data with model , to get prediction .

ML2---

Wine Quality Review- we have huge dataset of wines quality , taste, region wise description.
on basis of points we divide the category in dataset to get Target label.
we were using two differnt embedding methods -
